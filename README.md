# 🎒 Backpack Manager WebApp

### 📘 Design and Analysis of Algorithms – Visualization Project

Welcome to the **Backpack Manager**, a simple and intuitive frontend web project designed to simulate algorithmic behavior for solving classic problems like the **Knapsack Problem**.

Built entirely with:

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** *(if any stylesheets used)*
* **JavaScript** *(if interactive logic present)*

> Ideal for educational demonstrations, this web project aims to provide a UI-based explanation of algorithmic decision-making.
